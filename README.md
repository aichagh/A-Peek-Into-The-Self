## Artist Statement

### Formal Qualities

This piece is an apartment building where every 20 to 50 seconds, we get to peer into a different window for a few moments. Multiple windows may light up at once. Each window is tied to a song on my spotify “liked songs” playlist. The duration for which a window is lit is proportional to the length of the song. The placement of the person (towards the middle vs. off to the side) is determined by the mode (major or minor). The position has some randomness added to add variety. After a window is done being lit, it is “off” for anywhere between 20 to 50 seconds (at random). After that, a new song is chosen and the process is repeated.

### Context

In one of the psych courses I took (PSYCH 356, personality), my professor described personality with the following analogy: “different aspects of your personality are like tenants in a house; they each occupy space on a floor.Having a balanced personality is akin to having all tenants living together in peace”.
Music is an important component of my life; since middle school, it’s rare to see me walk around without headphones on.  Thus, I feel like the songs I listen to are “a part of me”, just like aspects of personality may be.
I also wanted to convey the feeling of “sonder”, that is, the feeling that each passer-by has a life just as complex as yours without your knowledge. I often feel this when walking by apartment buildings in the area, especially at night when the inside of the apartments is more visible.
